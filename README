## Additional explanations

* React just mimics how the javascript DOM works.
* React Fiber is an ongoing reimplementation of React's core algorithm. It is the culmination of over two years of research by the React team. Check our React Fiber on github.

### What is reconciliation?

* reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
* The central idea of React's API is to think of updates as if they cause the entire app to re-render.

### Reconciliation versus rendering

* The reason it can support so many targets is because React is designed so that reconciliation and rendering are separate phases.

### What is a fiber?

* We've established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling. Specifically, we need to be able to

  * pause work and come back to it later.

  * assign priority to different types of work.
  * reuse previously completed work.
  * abort work if it's no longer needed.

## 04-Props

* tailwindcss and props app

### Props?

* React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.

* Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.

* Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag

* Props let you think about parent and child components independently
